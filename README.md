# Mackenzie Wood Bison Population Dynamics Analysis 2015

The Mackenzie Wood Bison (*Bison bison athabascae*) herd abundance has been 
estimated in four years since 1999 while herd composition data has been 
collected in all but three years. The herd composition data is collected in 
July while the abundance estimates are for March.

The primary questions this analysis attempts to answer are:

> What is the survival of calves, yearlings and adult in the Mackenzie herd?

> Is survival of calves in the Mackenzie herd driven by climatic conditions?
